1 Program Overview
Today we are “drowning in data and starving for information”, while acknowledging that “data is the new
gold”. However, deriving value from all the data now available requires a transformation in data analysis, in
how we see, maintain, share and understand data. Data Engineering is an emerging profession concerned
with the task of acquiring large collections of data and extracting insights from them. It is driving the next
generation of technological innovation and scientific discovery, which is expected to be strongly data-driven.
The graduate program in Data Engineering offers a fascinating and profound insight into the methods and
technologies of this rapidly growing area. The program combines the big data aspects of “Data Analytics” as
well as of “Data Science” with the technological challenges of data acquisition, curation, and management.
Thus, the program provides the essentials for paving the way to a successful career: computer skills and
mathematical understanding paired with practical experience in selected application fields. Thereby the
program aims to educate a new generation of data specialists: Experts for data acquisition, management,
analysis and security.
Even though the Data Engineering program is embedded in the School of Computer Science and Engineering,
its interdisciplinary nature is taken into account by including courses from the School of Science and the
School of Business, Social & Decision Sciences and Advanced Projects in research groups in all schools on
campus are an integral part of this study program.
The Data Engineering program attracts students with diverse career goals, backgrounds, and prior work
experience. Therefore, the program offers a wide range of elective modules from which the students can
choose to specialize further, ranging from modules in Computer Science, Geo-Informatics, Bio-Informatics to
Business & Supply Chain Engineering. These elective modules furthermore prepare the students for the
Advanced Projects within the Discovery Area and the Master Thesis.
The graduate program in Data Engineering is tailored to a diverse student body (see also Section 1.2) with a
wide variety of interests, academic backgrounds, and previous experiences. Small group sizes, a low student-
to-teacher ratio, and personalized supervision/advising allow the program to cater a student who has just
graduated with a Bachelors’ degree, as well as a person who already has been employed in a data-intensive
company and who wants to keep up with current data engineering practices.

IT Law MDSSB-LAW-01 Lecture 2.5
Module Description
Digital information, the Internet, and applications like YouTube or social networking tools like
Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter have disrupted legal systems (Murray 2016). IT law is not limited to
one legal area but encompasses civil, public, and criminal laws. It spans from human rights law to
intellectual property law, contract and consumer protection law, privacy law, data protection law, and
other legal domains. Moreover, the global exchange of data is in conflict with the territorial principle
of jurisdiction. In addition, IT regulations are in a constant flux to keep up with the accelerated pace of
technological progress. This module looks into the most important areas of IT law. It provides the
participants with a sound understanding of legal principles and regulations, and sheds light on
international as well as European ICT policies and governance. A special focus will be given to the
European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

MDE-CO-11 Lecture 5
Module Description
Enterprises at any time need to know where their business stands in order to make the right decisions.
Obviously, manifold internal and external factors have an impact and hence have to be gathered and
combined to achieve the best possible decision support for the managers. The software technology
aiming at this goal, summarized as Business Intelligence (BI), performs various tasks such as
information collection and homogenization, analytics and data mining, and visualization through
dashboards etc.
From an information management perspective, the central BI component is the Data Warehouse (DW),
a subject-oriented, integrated, time-variant, non-volatile pool of data supporting management
decision processes. The analytics carried out is subsumed as Online Analytical Processing (OLAP), the
central structure is that of a multi-dimensional OLAP datacube.
In this course, an introduction to Data Warehousing is given. First an introduction to the world of
warehousing is presented, followed by a software architecture perspective. A deep dive into the
information management aspect inspects OLAP databases and datacubes (with all implications such as
query workloads, normal forms, query optimization, etc.), the challenges to extract, transform, and
load (ETL) to continuously feed the warehouse, and tools for getting insight from datacubes, ranging
from simple spreadsheets to complex data mining. The plot finalizes with a glance at current research
issues.

Image Processing for Data Engineers MDE-CO-05 Lecture 5
Module Description
Images are ubiquitous in society and science. All kinds of sensors turn physical phenomena into visual
representations that we interpret to learn, take decisions, or just enjoy. In parallel, digital imaging
sensors have become a commodity, resulting in massive amounts of images stored on the internet.
They contain implicit knowledge about our world, and it is a data engineers’ task to be able to extract
their information and generate knowledge from it.
Appreciating this central role of image in data science and data engineering, this module introduces
the basic concepts and applications of image processing for data engineers. This module’s aim is to
enable students:
- To understand the relation of physical phenomena and their image representation, including
sensors that don’t necessarily yield human-interpretable images,
- To acquire, store, retrieve, and work with image data in an efficient way,
- To transform images using different methods from hand-crafted algorithms to machine
learning and deep learning pipelines,
- And to perform operations on them to extract useful information and knowledge.
This course introduces sampling and quantization strategies, elementary image transformations, and
higher-level information extraction techniques like noise reduction, image segmentation, and feature
extraction leading up to image analysis automation.
The module will be taught along real-world applications relevant for data engineers, such as in
biomedical imaging, pattern recognition and classification. It will provide an overview of the broader
37
field of image processing. Homework assignments will cover Python implementations of basic and
combined image processing algorithms.
Recommended Knowledge
- Basic linear algebra, calculus and programming skills
- Reading the syllabus is recommended

Big Data Challenge MDE-CO-01 Lecture 5
Module Description
Big data is one of the buzz words of the current decade and refers to the collection and exploration of
complex data sets. This complexity of big data is typically described by the four V’s: Volume, Velocity,
Variety, and Veracity. From a business perspective, big data is often portrayed as a sea of big
opportunities. The public debate is torn between the two poles portrayed by the writers George Orwell
and Aldous Huxley: complete surveillance resulting in oppression on the one end, and irrelevance and
narcissism on the other. Technological research quite naturally is mostly concerned with the technical
feasibility of different approaches, the continuously increasing challenges with respect to the four V’s,
and the creative solutions needed to tackle them.
In this module students receive an overview of big data by looking at it from various perspectives,
primarily the business and societal points of view. The focus is not on the technical methods and skills,
but on case studies that show big data and data engineering in a cross-section.

Machine Learning MDE-CO-04 Lecture 5
Module Description
Machine learning (ML) is a module that concerns algorithms that are fed with (large quantities of) real-
world data, and which return a compressed "model" of the data. An example is the "world model" of
a robot: the input data are sensor data streams, from which the robot learns a model of its
environment. Another example is a spoken language model: the input data are speech recordings,
from which ML methods build a model of spoken English -- useful, for instance, in automated speech
recognition systems. There are many formalisms in which such models can be cast, and an equally
large diversity of learning algorithms. At the same time, there is a relatively small number of
fundamental challenges that are common to all of these formalisms and algorithms.
The module introduces such fundamental concepts and illustrates them with a choice of elementary
model formalisms (linear classifiers and regressors, radial basis function networks, clustering, neural

Module Description
Medical monitoring, smart cars, smart grids, smart homes, and ubiquitous connections to the internet
everywhere: There will be an ocean of data not only entered by humans but also automatically pouring
in from billions of sensors deployed in a plethora of devices. How are such data collected, and how can
they be made available to you, to your doctor, or to other users? These are only some of the questions
to be addressed. This module offers a hands-on introduction to the technology behind the scenes.
Topics include microcontrollers; how to program them; the way they interact with sensors and
actuators; and the wireless techniques they use to communicate with each other, with other
computers, and with the internet.
As the module covers a wide range of platforms, it also utilizes aspects from a variety of different
languages and devices. To be successful, it helps to be familiar with basic electrical circuits,
microcontrollers, HTML, PHP, SQL, C, and Python. Although there will be a lot of support, it is
recommended to be familiar with at least a few of these aspects.

Principles of Statistical Modeling MDE-CS-03 Lecture 5
Module Description
This module introduces the basic concepts of statistical modeling. The focus is on a thorough
understanding of fundamental concepts: the nature of probability spaces and random variables;
distributions and their representations; design and critical assessment of real-life samples; statistical
hypothesis testing; statistical decision-making; strategies for estimator design. This module is
distinguished from standard probability courses for non-mathematical audiences in that the
mathematical model of „probability” is rigorously introduced, including sigma-fields.
The primary educational aim is to lift students to a level of mastery and understanding of the intricate
formalism of probability and statistics that enables them to read the respective scientific literature and
to adapt existing algorithms or even develop new algorithms. This module is thus targeted at students
who want to go beyond a mere mechanical use of existing statistical toolboxes, and develop innovative
data analysis techniques of their own design.
The secondary educational aims are to enable students to (i) understand the substantial differences
between methodological approaches and fundamental mindsets in statistics vs. machine learning and
(ii) understand the differences between and respective advantages and disadvantages of classical
frequentist vs. Bayesian modeling methods.

Module Description
The theory of networks - as diverse as power grids, computer networks, social networks, and biological
networks - has emerged in recent years as a highly dynamic and rapidly developing discipline. The
study of networks is broadly interdisciplinary and important developments have occurred in many
fields, including mathematics, physics, computer and information sciences, biology, and the social
sciences. This module introduces this field, starting with a review of the diverse realizations of
networks. We then teach how to measure the structure of networks and introduce methods for
analyzing network data.
We introduce graph theory, which forms the basis of network theory. Then, we review computer
algorithms and spectral methods to analyze networks. We introduce various mathematical models of
networks, including random graph models and generative models, and conclude with more recent
theories that model the dynamical processes taking place on networks.

Module Description
This course deepens knowledge and skills in managing and serving Big Data with emphasis on flexibility
and scalability. As a result of this course, students will know the state of the art in data management
for particularly large and complex data, including in cloud-based data setups. Based on the Data
Engineering Core lecture Data Management the course starts with a reinspection of classical SQL,
preparing an overview of SQL query processing.
Based on this understanding opportunities of optimization and parallelization are discussed.
Subsequently, novel developments in Big Data services are discussed. NoSQL approaches with their
new data models are inspected, such as documents, graphs and arrays. This is contrasted with NewSQL
and their novel techniques for competitive performance. Dedicated architectures are discussed, such
as MapReduce.
This leads to general scalability considerations, with an emphasis on large-scale parallel and distributed
processing. Throughout the course practical considerations play an important role, including
practitioner hints on database modeling, tuning, and security. Practical guided hands-on exercises
complement this.

Module Description
Machine learning (ML) is a module that concerns algorithms that are fed with (large quantities of) real-
world data, and which return a compressed "model" of the data. An example is the "world model" of
a robot: the input data are sensor data streams, from which the robot learns a model of its
environment. Another example is a spoken language model: the input data are speech recordings,
from which ML methods build a model of spoken English -- useful, for instance, in automated speech
recognition systems. There are many formalisms in which such models can be cast, and an equally
large diversity of learning algorithms. At the same time, there is a relatively small number of
fundamental challenges that are common to all of these formalisms and algorithms.
The module introduces such fundamental concepts and illustrates them with a choice of elementary
model formalisms (linear classifiers and regressors, radial basis function networks, clustering, neural
networks). Furthermore, the module also (re) introduces required mathematical material from
probability theory and linear algebra. The main educational aims are twofold: to make students fully
aware of the two main hurdles for obtaining good models from data: (i) the "curse of dimensionality"
and (ii) the bias-variance dilemma and to provide standard tools to cope with these difficulties, namely
(i') dimension reduction by feature extraction, for example via PCA or clustering, and (ii') cross-
validation and regularization.

Module Description
This is a hands-on module on the mathematical and computational modeling of various complex
systems, covering diverse fields of the natural and social sciences. The module starts with an
introduction to mathematical modeling. The elements of a model are presented and the steps to follow
when constructing a model are reviewed, from formulating the question, determining the basic
constituents of a model, and qualitatively and quantitatively describing the relevant system to
analyzing the equations with various checks and balances. An introduction are provided on Python,
the programming language constituting the main computational tool adopted in the module. To put
into practice the theory on the basics of modelling and Python programming, a number of classical
models in ecology are reviewed, coded, and numerically analyzed. This will build up the skills for
developing models that describe different complex systems and the associated processes. In particular,
different ial equation models are developed.
They describe:
(1) the dynamics of diseases such as HIV, (2) the microbial growth in batch and chemostat cultures, (3)
the dynamics of plankton ecosystems in the oceanic mixed layer, and (4) examples of life acting as a
regulating force at a planetary scale. In addition, the lecturer introduces Agent-Based Modelling
techniques with applications to cultural segregation problems and spatially explicit predator-prey
interactions.

Data Analytics in Supply Chain
Management
MSCM-CO-07 Lecture 5
Module Description
In recent years, big data has become a significant topic in supply chain management, as the amount of
data generated in supply chain management practices has grown exponentially. Data analytics are
techniques that apply data mining, statistical analysis, predictive analytics, and machine learning to
uncover hidden patterns, correlations, trends, and other business-valuable information and
knowledge from data.
The module focuses on the supply chain management scenarios that generate and consume data
intensively and require data analytics to improve the decision-making process through descriptive,
predictive, and prescriptive analytics. These include:
- Descriptive statistics on and historical insight into companies’ production, financial, operations, sales,
customers, etc.
- Forecasting customer behavior, purchasing patterns, production performance, energy consumption,
etc.
- Prescriptive analytics for assessing the offer that should be made to a certain customer, to decide on
the shipment strategy for each location, to determine the most efficient material flow in a factory, etc.

Module Description
Predictions based on the past, with or without additional input information? This is the topic of our
module on dynamical systems. In many cases these forecasts are (almost) exact; in others we can only
get probabilistic information. Based on a large set of examples, the module is going to discuss these
so-called deterministic and stochastic systems. Topics we cover include:
- Deterministic low-dimensional dynamical systems.
- Control of deterministic linear systems.
- Linear prediction of stochastic time series.
Recommended Knowledge
- Basic linear algebra, calculus, probability concepts and programming skills as taught in introductory
modules.
- Read the book: "Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos: With Applications to Physics, Biology, Chemistry,
and Engineering" by Steven H. Strogatz, in particular parts I+II. In order to prepare, please, read
chapters 1,2+5.
Usability and Relationship to other Modules
Complementary to the machine Learning module MDE-CO-04 this module focuses on a theory-based
design of models. Such models, if available, are usually “smaller” and easier to parameterize.

Module Description
In machine learning we aim at extracting meaningful representations, patterns and regularities from
high-dimensional data. In recent years, researchers from various disciplines have developed “deep”
hierarchical models, i.e. models that consist of multiple layers of nonlinear processing. An important
property of these models is that they can “learn” by reusing and combining intermediate concepts, so
that these models can be used successfully in a variety of domains, including information retrieval,
natural language processing, and visual object detection. After a brief introduction into core
knowledge related to training, model evaluation and multilayer perceptrons, this module focuses on
the exposing students to deep learning techniques including convolutional and recurrent neural
networks, autoencoders, generative adversarial networks and reinforcement learning. The central aim
is hence to enable students to critically assess and apply modern methods in machine learning.
Recommended Knowledge
- This module is recommended for students that have been exposed to core knowledge in machine
learning / statistical learning on undergraduate level. Students without this background knowledge can
66
still join since required core knowledge is re-introduced. Preparation via auxiliary literature or online
courses will facilitate the start into the course.
- Strong knowledge and abilities in mathematics (linear algebra, calculus).
Usability and Relationship to other Modules
While the graduate level modules "Data Analytics" and "Machine Learning" provide an applied
introduction to the field and are therefore recommended for students with a focus on Software
Engineering or Cybersecurity, this module complements the undergraduate module "Machine
Learning" or can be used independently as a strong introduction to the field of Deep Learning.
Intended Learning Outcomes
No Competence ILO
1 Understand Understand core techniques to train neural networks.
2 Select Select from modern neural network architectures the most appropriate
method (e.g. convolutional and recurrent neural networks) based on given

Module Description
This module offers a highly structured introduction to the fundamentals of combinatorics and
probabilities as they are used for statistical modeling and estimation. It is a gateway for graduate
students who have not been exposed to the topics so far, or who were exposed long ago and needs to
be refreshed. The module starts with the concept of probabilities, including joint, conditional and total
probabilities with a focus on independence, which leads us to a discussion of Bayes’s theorem. We
shall then proceed to factorials, and binomial coefficients, with many applications to be followed by
the binomial law, and its Poisson and Normal approximations. A second block covers random variables
with their distributions and density functions. Here we are going to discuss continuous random
variables in detail. Block three continues with the essential ideas of expected values, moments, and
estimation.
Usability and Relationship to other Modules
Familiarity with probability-related concepts is the basis to understand the foundations of stochastic
modelling and the data analytics and machine learning techniques which form a central part of data
engineering. There is a placement test offered in the orientation week before the start of the first

Module Description
This module aims to provide the student with an in-depth understanding and command of one of the
data analytics or data management techniques that are represented by the research groups of the
faculty of DE. The subdiscipline involved (e.g. database management, machine learning, statistical data
analysis, information theory, data acquisition, or big data technologies) changes from year to year and
from hosting group to hosting group. The detailed structure and schedule depend on the specific
demands and options of the hosting group.
An Advanced Project module typically begins with an introduction to the concerned technology or
method. This leads the student to a level of competence with which he/she can insightfully apply the
respective methods to practical, real-life tasks. Typically, the second half of the module is devoted to
individual (or if indicated, group) projects in which a nontrivial data management/ analysis task, given
by the instructor, is completed. The project outcome is a technical report (target size: 20 pages)
together as well as with a presentation to the Data Engineering program students and faculty.

Module Description
Students can work on an internship in a company, government institution, or non-governmental
organization to gain practical experience and to apply their knowledge and skills in data engineering in
practice. A minimum of 231 working hours (corresponding to 6 weeks of full-time occupation, which
can also be done part time stretched over a longer period starting from the 2nd semester) is required
for the successful completion of this module, which then can replace two advanced projects of 5CP
each. This gives students the opportunity to train, foster, and apply their acquired skills in data
engineering in a professional setting. Students engage with the corporate world, learn how to cope
and excel in a new environment. The internship content must be relevant to data engineering. Task
specifications need to be appropriate for a master’s level student. The module coordinator, the student
advisor and the Career Service Center will support students in finding suitable positions. The student
needs to find a faculty member at Constructor University who agrees to be the academic supervisor
prior to starting the internship. The module coordinator then decides on the eligibility of the internship
to replace two advanced projects of 5CP each, prior to the start of the internship.
The internship provides training and experiential learning opportunities for data engineering in a
professional setting. It assists the students’ development of employer-valued skills, such as teamwork,
communication, steadiness, and attention to detail. It exposes the students to the environment and
performance expectations in the corporate world, may help prepare an application-oriented master
thesis, and may make the entry into the professional job market easier.

Master Thesis MDE-THE-01
Module Description
The aim of this module is to train students to motivate, design, carry out and document a research
project in one of the areas represented by the research groups of the faculty of DE. Some familiarity
with the requisite data engineering techniques will typically have been acquired in one of the
preceding Advanced Projects (MDE-DIS-02 or MDE-DIS-03). The thesis topic is determined in mutual
agreement with the module instructor. They may arise from the ongoing research in the instructor’s
own research group, but it is also possible for a student to adopt a topic of his/her own choice provided
the instructor agrees to supervise it.
The thesis work comprises the full cycle of a scientific research endeavor: (i) identifying a relevant open
research question, (ii) carrying out a literature survey to put the planned work in its context and relate
it to the state of the art (SoA), (iii) formulate a concrete research objective, (iv) design a research plan
including a statement of criteria to evaluate the success of the project, (v) carry out the plan (with the
possibility to change the original plan when motivated), (vi) document the results, (vii) analyze the
results with respect to the SoA, the original objective, and the success criteria, and (viii) document all
of this in a thesis report.
All of this work should be done with as much self-guidance as can be reasonably expected. The
instructor will likely give substantial guidance for (i) and (iii), whereas the other aspects will be
addressed with larger degrees of self-guidance. A research proposal document summarizing (i) – (iv) is
expected as an interim result and milestone (target size: 10 pages). In the first weeks of the course, an
intense taught tutorial on scientific working and writing is held. The subsequent weeks follow a
seminar style where students present and discuss literature as well as their own results to date. The
project consists of the proposal, a thesis report (target size: 30–60 pages, and an oral presentation at
the end of the course.

Module Description
The academically rigorous nature of graduate studies requires students to master academic writing
skills and techniques. In this introductory course, students in DE master’s program will learn the
foundations of academic writing at a graduate level, with special focus on writing academic essays,
identifying organizational patterns of academic texts, and formulating arguments to produce cohesive
and coherent academic papers. Through the process of drafting, continuous feedback and editing,
students will improve their writing skills. This course will also help students develop their research skills
by highlighting techniques of finding and evaluating sources, and utilizing citation and referencing
styles. As graduate students, adhering to The Code of Academic Integrity is a requirement. Hence, this
course will incorporate a session on scholarly and intellectual standards set by Constructor University.
The second part of this course is a training seminar. It will give answers to frequently asked questions
by students on the topics of working and living in Germany. Here the students will find information on
employment and how to get access to the German labor market. The seminar also provides an
overview of labor conditions in Germany, the multifaceted forms of employment, business cultures
and useful tips and information for the job entry in a German company.

Ethics and the Information Revolution MDSSB-EIR-01 Seminar 2.5
Module Description
Many data specialists claim that we are at the cusp of an information revolution. Based on inventions
dating back to WWII, IT innovations have re-organized our society around one “big metadata
computer” that is permanently computing data and associating metadata about everything we do.
Digital technologies also have the potential to disrupt the ethical standards and rules of our society. In
this module, we discuss whether we have to forfeit privacy in times of big data, if machines
compromise our identity, and if shared data enables institutions to abuse their power and undermine
the civil society?
The module pursues three goals. 1. Participants will immerse themselves and learn about core ethical
theories. 2. They will integrate this theoretical knowledge and develop a “Big Data Ethics,” which they
3. will put into practice. For the second and third purposes, in-classroom discussions and interactions
are indispensable for identifying possible dilemmas and conflict of interests and for balancing
contradictions to derive practical solutions and policy advice.
